# Car Price Prediction Using Macine Learning
### Final Capstone Project - Danish Ali

## Project Overview
An automobile company aspires to create a Machine Learning Model that estimate used car prices from a given dataset. It Will facilitate a buying and selling of used cars for individuals and dealerships.

## Goal of the Project
* To understand the important features of dataset which are affecting selling prices of the cars.
* To dicover the best ML model for an automobile company to assist individuals and dealerships for prediction of the cars prices.

This graph depicts following points:
* Selling Price of cars seems to have higher prices when sold by Dealers when compared to Individuals.
* It can be observed that Selling Price would be higher for cars that are Automatic.
